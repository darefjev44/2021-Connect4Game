# Connect4Game

A "simple" game of connect 4.

This will be a GUI application.

Start game -> pick game settings (defaults being "classic" connect 4) -> Go

Game setting ideas:
Board Size
Player Colors
VS AI? (Stupid: Random placements, Easy: Random placement to begin with, random placements within 1 column of last placement after. Impossible: Some proper connect4 algorithm)
